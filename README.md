# Reflection
Making my portfolio website using GitHub Pages was a good learning experience for me. At first, I found it hard to set up the repository and upload files, but by following the steps and exploring the platform, I was able to do it. It felt great to see my site go live and have a link I could share.

I also learned the importance of version control, organization, and testing on different devices. Having my work online made me realize how useful GitHub is for both storing and showing projects.

If I improve my portfolio, I will add better design, interactive features, and update it with new projects. This taught me that a portfolio is not just a requirement, but also a way to show my growth and skills.

# Challenges Faced and Solutions
One of the challenges I faced while creating my portfolio was figuring out how to use GitHub. At first, I didn’t really understand how repositories worked or where to put my files. I also got confused with the Git commands like commit and push, and I was worried I might mess something up and my site wouldn’t show online.

To get through this, I followed the instructions step by step and also explored GitHub on my own. I tried using both the website and GitHub Desktop to upload files until I felt more confident. I also made sure my index.html was in the right place and double-checked everything whenever I ran into errors.

In the end, I realized GitHub isn’t as scary as it first looked. With practice, I was able to publish my portfolio and see it live, which felt really rewarding. This experience taught me to be patient, to keep trying when things don’t work right away, and to trust myself to figure things out.

# Future Improvements
Even though my portfolio is already live and working, there are still many things I want to improve. I’d like to make the design more modern by using better layouts, smoother animations, and nicer color choices to make it more attractive. I also want to add some interactivity with JavaScript, like filters for projects, a responsive menu, and other small features that make the site easier to use.

I also plan to keep updating the Projects section whenever I finish something new. This way, my portfolio will always stay fresh and show how I’m growing over time. I want to make it more accessible too, by adding alt text for images, improving text contrast, and making sure the site is simple to navigate for everyone.

In the future, I’d also like to include a downloadable resume and a contact form so people can reach me directly. These changes will make my portfolio not just a display of my work, but also a professional tool that can help me with future opportunities.
